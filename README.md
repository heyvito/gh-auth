# gh-auth

**gh-auth** is a simple utility that serves files to users authenticated from
GitHub.

To use it, you will need to register a new OAuth Application. More information
can be found on [GitHub's Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app).

Then, start `gh-auth` after setting the following environment variables:

- `GITHUB_KEY`: Your OAuth App's key
- `GITHUB_SECRET`: Your OAuth App's secret
- `SECRET_KEY`: A random string used to encrypt cookies
- `ALLOWED_USERS`: A comma-separated list of users allowed to authenticate on this instance.

With the following command-line options:

- `-host [0.0.0.0]`: Host to bind the server. Defaults to `0.0.0.0`.
- `-port [8000]`: Port to bind the server. Defaults to `8000`.
- `-root [PATH]`: Root path from where to serve files from.
